A Data Access Object (DAO) is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application and the data persistence mechanism, typically a database. 
Its purpose is to encapsulate the logic for accessing, manipulating, and managing data within the underlying data storage system.

The DAO pattern separates the business logic of an application from the details of how data is accessed and manipulated. 
It provides a clean and consistent interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data objects, hiding the specific implementation details of the underlying database.

The key components of a DAO typically include:

1. **Data Object**: The Data Object represents the data entity or object being persisted. It encapsulates the data and provides getter and setter methods to access and modify the data properties.

2. **DAO Interface**: The DAO Interface defines the contract or set of methods that the DAO implementations must implement. It specifies the operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete data objects.

3. **DAO Implementation**: The DAO Implementation provides the concrete implementation of the DAO interface. It includes the logic to interact with the database or data storage system, such as executing SQL queries, mapping data to objects, and handling transactions.

4. **Connection Management**: The DAO may also handle the management of database connections, including establishing connections, handling connection pooling, and releasing connections after use.
